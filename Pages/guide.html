				<center><h2> The A Line Dress:</h2></center>
				<!--http://fashion.about.com/cs/glossary/g/bldefaline.htm-->
				<p> "A-line" was first used by the iconic fashion designer Christian Dior, though his use as the name of his 1955 collection is not how we've come to think of a-line today. Our definition of "A-line" actually comes from another iconic designer (and Christian Dior's successor at his namesake label), Yves Saint Laurent. In 1958 he created the "Trapeze Collection" that featured silhouettes that flared out dramatically from the shoulder.
				<br><br>
				The a-line dress definition that will sound most familiar to shoppers today is a dress or skirt silhouette that is narrower at the waist and flaring gently wider from the hip, thereby resembling the letter "A." A true A-line skirt or dress has no pleats or slits for ease of wear, but may have darts or seams at the hip to improve the fit and shape. A-line dresses and skirts were especially popular in the 1950s and 1960s (think Betty Draper on Mad Men) but waned in popularity until the early 2000s when the retro look make a bit of a comeback.</p>

				<center><h2> Silhouette Defining Print Dress:</h2></center>
				<p> Prints are great for either showing off or camouflaging your curves. When wearing a larger, bold print, make sure the shape is form fitting and skims your curves. If a style fits loosely across your frame, one can appear even broader.

				Large prints are an amazing illusion and can slim down your figure. To create a slimming silhouette by using prints, pay close attention to placement and your proportions. If you have a larger bottom half, choose dark, demure prints or color below the waist and explore bolder, larger prints above the waistline. This will draw the eye upwards and balance your frame by slimming down your hips and thighs. For a refined look, make sure to tuck your top at your natural waistline.</p>

				<center><h2> Modest Crop Top:</h2></center>
				<p> We don&#146;t think it&#146;s an exaggeration to say that crop tops are probably the most anxiety-enducing summer wardrobe staple. Although they&#146;re very on-trend and don&#146;t seem to be going anywhere, partly due to Kim Kardashian&#146;s unmatchable skill at making them look accessible to everyone, many a woman (understandably) has an undeniable hesitation that they just won&#146;t work for her body type. <br>
				We&#146;re here to squash those fears before they can really take root. Contrary to what many of us think, crop tops are actually one of the most flattering summer pieces you can choose, because they draw the eye to the thinnest part of pretty much every woman&#146;s body: The area right at the middle of the ribcage, between the breasts and the waist. Whether you&#146;re long and lean, fit and trim, or pear-shaped and curvy, there&#146;s a way for you to wear crop tops.</p>

				<center><h2> Asymmetrical Tiered Skirt:</h2></center>
				<p> Like dresses, skirts are one of the most feminine and elegant pieces in a woman’s wardrobe. If jeans and other types of pants are considered to be maximum comfortable and functional, there are days when you want to feel special, girlish, feminine and different from guys. We have seen so many amazing skirt trends for the spring/summer 2012 season, like super mini, elegant midi and even maxi skirts, yet among so many offerings there is one stand-out style, the asymmetrical skirt. Asymmetrical skirts are unique, beautiful and interesting, but they are especially great for accentuating your best assets and hiding more unflattering, problem areas.</p>

				<center><h2> Print Gone Rogue:</h2></center>
				<p> The animal print phenomena is a somewhat amusing yet increasingly popular psychosocial fashion boom whereby (mostly female) members of our species adorn themselves and the objects around them with jungle animal patterns ranging from leopard, cheetah, tiger and jaguar, through to snake, zebra and even giraffe.<br>
				Animal print can be seen adoringly zipped, wrapped, draped and strapped on bodies of all shapes and ages. It graces the streets of every city and appears to be permitted in almost all cultures across our wonderful planet.</p>

				<center><h2> The Head Piece:</h2></center>
				<!--http://char.txa.cornell.edu/griebel.htm-->
				<p> 
				The headwrap originated in sub-Saharan Africa, and serves similar functions for both African and African American women. In style, the African American woman's headwrap exhibits the features of sub-Saharan aesthetics and worldview. In the United States, however, the headwrap acquired a paradox of meaning not customary on the ancestral continent. During slavery, white overlords imposed its wear as a badge of enslavement! Later it evolved into the stereotype that whites held of the "Black Mammy" servant. The enslaved and their descendants, however, have regarded the headwrap as a helmet of courage that evoked an image of true homeland-be that ancient Africa or the newer homeland, America. The simple head rag worn by millions of enslaved women and their descendants has served as a uniform of communal identity; but at its most elaborate, the African American woman's headwrap has functioned as a "uniform of rebellion" signifying absolute resistance to loss of self-definition.'</p>

				<center><h2> The Dramatic Peice:</h2></center>
				<p> Candidates for dramatic style will be ladies with noticeable appearances.  This type of ladies has something which makes their faces difficult to forget. The face proportions may not necessarily be ideal; they may have bigger than usual noses or lips – some features which make them really stand out! They are beautiful, they are striking and they make the heads turn.
				<br><br>
				The main attributes of this style are: sexiness, luxury, lavishness and staginess. The first thing that comes to my mind when I try to describe this style is “lady vamp” – dangerous due to her wild nature, but extremely attractive and unforgettable.
				<br><br>
				Rich and luxurious colors such as red, orange, dark emerald, burgundy, purple and black will suit dramatic style really well. Among materials for clothing are lace, velvet, satin, silk, fur and leather. Contrasting color blocking is something that also suits this style. Dramatic ladies will flourish on contrasts in their outfits; for example, combining something romantic, such as silk dress with something masculine, such as leather jacket. Think bold and luxurious clothing, if you identified your style as “dramatic”. Do not be afraid to wear bright makeup which accentuates your beauty.</p>
